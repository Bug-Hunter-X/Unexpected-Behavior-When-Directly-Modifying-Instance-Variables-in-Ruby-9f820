This repository demonstrates a common error in Ruby that can occur when directly modifying instance variables without using accessor methods.  Directly manipulating instance variables via `instance_variable_set` or `instance_variable_get` can lead to issues such as inconsistent state and bypassing any logic within getter and setter methods. The example shows how this practice can break encapsulation and make code harder to maintain and debug.  The solution file provides a more robust approach using accessor methods.
